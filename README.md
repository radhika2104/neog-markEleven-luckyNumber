# Is your birthday lucky?

This is a project created in Neo G camp, LevelZero for markEleven.

This is an app which takes in user's input of birthday and validates if it is a lucky number based on user's input of his/her lucky number.

## Features

- Takes input of user's complete birthday and lucky lucky number

- Finds out if the sum of digits of a birthday is divisible by the lucky number
  - funny output: if the user enters 0 as a lucky number, the output is 'fate not defined' since we cannot divide a value by 0
- Shows the output if the birthdate is lucky or not to the user depending on the calculated results.
- Shows the result to the user with some cool gifs.
- Bonus Features: has footer that connects to all social media accounts.
